/**
 A first brute-force approach would be to compute every single subarray.
 1. Iterate from the start to the end
 2. Get the sliding-window for the current subarray
 3. Compute the sum
 This approach yelds a cubic solution, O(n^3), which is not feasible.
 
 Another approach is to save the sum of the previous subarray.
 1. Create a sliding window
 2. For the next n+1 size add the already computed sum
 
 As we want the **maximum subarray** there are some shortcuts to be made here.
 Calculate the sum progressively, if the current sum yields a negative number mark the
 accumulated sum as zero. This would be the same as restarting the sum with a new window.
 And as we want the **maximum** we keep on calculating the sum with the rest of the array.

     This is probably going to be the solution that you will come up with. Uses sliding window to compute all the possible combinations.
